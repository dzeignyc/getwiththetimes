      This project was built with <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Create React App </a>
       and hosted with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Netlify</a>.
      It utilizes ES6 syntax, React, and React Router.
